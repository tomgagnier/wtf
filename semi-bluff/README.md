Simplified Post Flop Odds
-------------------------

Use this formula to calculate your odds on a drawing hand:

	Number of outs * 2 * number of cards left
	
Outs: The number of cards that improve the hand
	

###Examples

| Hand  | Board       | Outs  | Explanation              |  % |
|-------|-------------|-------|--------------------------|----|
| Kh Jh | Ah Jc 3h    | 9 + 2 | 9 Hearts + 2 Jacks       | 44 |
| Kh Jh | Ah Jc 3h 2s | 9 + 2 | 9 Hearts + 2 Jacks       | 22 |
| Kh Jh | QC Th 3h    | 9 + 6 | 9 Hearts + 3 Aces + 3 9s | 60 |
| Kh Jh | QC Th 3h 2s | 9 + 6 | 9 Hearts + 3 Aces + 3 9s | 30 |


Semi-bluff
----------

A Semi-bluff is betting or raising on a drawing hand.  For Example,
raising when you hold a four flush after the flop.  The goal is
to **increase your expected value by adding fold equity**.

| C   | (1 -F).        | % opponent calls
| W   | Pot Equity     | % winning
| L   | (1 -W)         | % losing
| V   | Expected Value | The average gain or loss
